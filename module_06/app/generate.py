"""Augmentation and generation: RAG prompt template + a local LLM.

The "augmentation" step is the RAG prompt template itself: the retrieved
and reranked chunks are numbered and labeled with their source file, then
stuffed into a template that instructs the model to answer only from that
context and to cite which numbered chunk(s) it used - this is what turns
"passages that happen to be relevant" into "a grounded, checkable answer."

Generation calls a real local llama3.1 model running through Ollama.
