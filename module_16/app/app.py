# A tiny golden evaluation dataset - small enough to run against a
# live model on every call rather than needing to be versioned/stored
# separately. Two examples, deliberately chosen as a matched pair to show
# exact match's brittleness directly rather than by accident. The first
# question's reference is a bare phrase ("Paris.") while the model's
# natural answer is a full sentence ("The capital of France is Paris.")
# - exact_match is expected to be False here even though the answer is
# correct, while ROUGE-L and semantic similarity still give it credit.
# The second question explicitly asks the model to answer in one word,
# so its natural answer ("96") matches the reference exactly -
# exact_match is expected to be True here, giving the dataset one real
# example of each outcome instead of one metric always failing across
# the board.

# ~0.1 a genuinely wrong answer scores (see the regression check below).
