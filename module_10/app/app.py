"""Module 10 mini application: a multi-agent pipeline built with
LangGraph over a local llama3.1 model via Ollama, with a
human-in-the-loop checkpoint.

Agent roles (Section 2) wired in a Pipeline communication pattern
(Section 3):

    researcher -> writer -> human_review (pauses here) -> finalize

The human_review step (Section 6) pauses the whole graph with
langgraph.types.interrupt(), shows you the drafted paragraph, and
waits for a real decision - approve it, reject it, or type replacement
text - before the graph resumes and finalizes.

Run:
    python app.py
