"""Model routing strategy: classify a query's complexity, route to 
a cheap or powerful tier, and cascade up if the cheap tier's answer
was cut off before finishing.

Only `llama3.1` is pulled locally, so both tiers call the same underlying
model - "cheap" vs "powerful" is simulated via generation settings (a tight
vs generous `num_predict`/`temperature`), not a real model swap. See the
README for why a second real model wasn't pulled for this exercise.
