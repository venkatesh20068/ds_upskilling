"""LangGraph agent for incident investigation.

An `agent` node (Gemini, bound to fetch_logs/fetch_metrics/search_runbooks)
decides which tools to call and when it has enough evidence, looping
through a `tools` node until it stops requesting calls. A separate,
tool-free `extract` node then turns its plain-language summary into a
structured JSON RCA report.

Every model turn is logged to Langfuse as a "generation" observation and
every tool call as a "tool" observation (tracer.py) - reconstructed by
`_log_transcript` from the finished message list once the run completes.

Investigate the alert below: call fetch_logs/fetch_metrics for the service(s)
the alert mentions first, but the true root cause is often an *earlier*
failure in a different, upstream service - if the evidence suggests that,
check other known services too before concluding. Once you've spotted a
clear symptom pattern, call search_runbooks to check it against a known
issue and fix. Once you have enough evidence, STOP calling tools and reply
with a plain-language investigation summary covering: what happened, the
order of failures across services (cite timestamps), the most likely root
cause (the earliest-failing service, not necessarily the one that reported
the alert), and the recommended fix from the runbook match.

If fetch_logs/fetch_metrics report no entries for every service you check
within the given time window, do NOT keep searching indefinitely - after
checking at most 2-3 services, stop and reply with a summary stating that
no evidence was found for this alert in this time window, at low
confidence, rather than exhausting your tool-call budget."""
